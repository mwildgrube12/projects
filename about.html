    <h3>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is May Wildgrube, a Tufts University Graduate with a dual major BS in Mechanical Engineering and Physics. I formerly led <a href="https://sedstufts.org/">Tufts SEDS Rocketry</a> for 3.5 years at university. As a part of this club, I massively scaled the team from 6 to 60 people and founded multiple project teams. In 2023, I first founded the <a href="https://www.soundingrocket.org/what-is-irec.html">IREC Team</a>, which successfully launched and recovered with full points in the 2024 and 2025 editions. In this program, I also started the Flight Computer subteam. In 2024, I also founded the Hybrid Rocket program, a passion project of mine, where I started the design and fabrication program of a rocket engine. As a part of this endeavor, I have designed the team structures as we grow and learn, and made many engineering decisions to optimize our learning and our success.

      In addition to my school activities, I formely worked at Sublime Systems as an Intern for a year. Here, I worked towards saving the environment with their mission of true carbon-zero cement. I expanded my skills to process engineering here, where I worked in a pilot plant where I designed various manifolds for the system and aided in scaling their process for design at a kiloton scale.

      Outside of school and work, I enjoy both the outdoors and marathon training (in which I have run 2 marathons). I'm also actively immersing myself in Japanese language and culture, and am studying for an eventual JLPT N2 certification. More recently, I have picked up fermentation in my free time, making kombucha and natural wines. I also collect orchids and drink a lot of chinese tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am looking for full-time positions in Mechanical Engineering specifically in the aerospace field. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at <a href="mailto:maywild@cassiopeia.cfd">maywild@cassiopeia.cfd</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a side project during this search I am teaching myself Rust to develop a Monte Carlo simulation for model rockets to predict the trajectory of my two-stage rocket. This will inform whether it is safe to ignite the second stage in flight. After I complete this, I will adapt it to run on my self-designed flight computer.
