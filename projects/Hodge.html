        <h3>Project Overview</h3>

        <p>I led the 2024-2025 IREC entry by Tufts University, dubbed “Hodge,” as both project co-lead and electrical team lead. This was our second year competing in the 10k ft COTS category and second year overall. The mission of this project was to improve our rocket from the previous entry and improve its engineering quality by setting stricter requirements and factors of safety and by using human-factors principles to improve its serviceability.</p>

        <p>As the project co-lead, I aided in setting new requirements and goals for the new rocket. These included setting new human factors requirements like accessible components in the avionics bay. As Electrical lead, I organized a sub-team of around 10 members into smaller projects such as a motor temperature monitor team and a ground station team, and set requirements and goals for these teams. I additionally directly lead the design of the main flight computer, contributing directly to its design decisions.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, the project ended with the rocket successfully launching at competition, with full recovery points. We had no faults in airframe and recovery systems; however, due to insufficient test data due to rain delays for 13 weekends straight, on-pad thermal issues caused much of the data collection systems to fail and we were only able to collect data off COTS systems. These COTS systems revealed we reached an altitude of 10203 feet, only 203 feet off target.</p>
